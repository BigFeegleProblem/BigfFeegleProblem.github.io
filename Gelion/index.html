    <h1>Gelion</h1>

    <h2>Rogue - Level 1</h2>

    <p>
      Born in the outskirts of the Gray Havens, Gelion was kidnapped one day in
      the woods and sold into slavery at a young age to the Servants of Ainur, a
      band of rogue Elvish assassins. Gelion was intended to serve as a slave to
      the Servants, but they were short on new recruits and put Gelion into
      training. Gelion roamed with his masters as a squire for some years. When
      he reached an age, he was released to roam Arda freely, but with the
      condition that he not stray from the Servants, lest he be hunted down
      himself. The creed of the Servants is to rid Arda of those deemed evil by
      the Servants. The Servants forbid the use of weapons or poison for the use
      of assassinations, as it is deemed evil, but they are allowed the use of a
      weapon such as a bow in self defense.
