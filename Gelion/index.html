        <h1>Gelion</h1>

        <h2>Rogue - Level 1</h2>

        <p>
          Born in the outskirts of the Gray Havens, Gelion was kidnapped one day
          in the woods and sold into slavery at a young age to the Servants of
          Ainur, a band of rogue Elvish assassins. Gelion was intended to serve
          as a slave to the Servants, but they were short on new recruits and
          put Gelion into training. Gelion roamed with his masters as a squire
          for some years. When he reached an age, he was released to roam Arda
          freely, but with the condition that he not stray from the Servants,
          lest he be hunted down himself. The creed of the Servants is to rid
          Arda of those deemed evil by the Servants. The Servants forbid the use
          of weapons or poison for the use of assassinations, as it is deemed
          evil, but they are allowed the use of a weapon such as a bow in self
          defense.
