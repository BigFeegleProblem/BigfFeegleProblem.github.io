        <h2>Things that should not have been forgotten</h2>

        <p>
          Many years ago in an earlier age, a great evil was banished from Arda
          by a fellowship of travelers chosen from all the races of free people.
          Since then, much about that evil has been forgotten, and names that
          were once feared or respected by even the bravest warriors or most
          skilled magicians have become mere fairy tales that are told to
          children. Some of the tales tell of times of fear to frighten young
          children into behaving, but the children's favorite stories tell of
          two friends. The friends were just simple people, nobodies really, and
          by all rights they shouldn't have been remembered if they had just
          lived out their lives like their neighbors. Fate, however, picked them
          for a much bigger role in history than they had bargained for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the bravery of the two friends, Arda was ridden of a great
          evil, but a small part remained and fled to the north, nursing its
          wounds and biding its time. Over the past centuries, it has slowly
          kindled its power and is preparing to unleash it on an unsuspecting
          Arda. Already, rangers of the north are beginning to hear troubling
          rumors of a growing darkness.
        </p>

        <h2>The Ear of Corn</h2>

        <p>
          One rainy night, a messenger bearing news from the rangers has stopped
          by a roadside pub to rest for the night. It is clear that something is
          troubling him, and after having drunk an unseemly amount of beer, he
          begins to ramble about the rumors he's heard. As the night wore one,
          the rest of the pubs clientele gradually trickle out, until only the
          messenger and a few misfits remain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each of the misfits had a hard life behind them, and often came to the
          pub to seek some solace from the hard world and share a drink among
          what friends they had. Sensing a kindred spirit with the messenger,
          who is now maudlin and sobbing into his beer, they gather around his
          table and ask him about his troubles.
